- [ ] Complete resolved dependency-tree and bundled-license audit
- [ ] Validate against a real non-production provider endpoint
- [ ] Add deeper Pipeline restart/abort integration coverage
- [ ] Run Jenkins Plugin Compatibility Tester / plugin verifier
- [ ] Perform an internal HPI installation on the target Jenkins baseline
- [ ] Open Jenkins plugin hosting request
- [ ] After Jenkins forks the repository, update project/SCM URLs to the canonical `jenkinsci` repository
- [ ] Obtain Jenkins repository release permissions
- [ ] Publish release notes
